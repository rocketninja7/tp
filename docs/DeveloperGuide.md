## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="400" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

<br>

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T13-0/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T13-0/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Database`**](#database-component) parses data from within the App on startup. This data is used to support user input validation according to the business logic.<br>
[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

<br>

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete CS2030S`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above), as well as the [**`Database`**](#database-component) component,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

<br>

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T13-0/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ModulePlanPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T13-0/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T13-0/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `ModulePlanSemester` object residing in the `Model`.

<br>

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T13-0/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

<br>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete CS2030S")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to a `ModulePlanParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

<br>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

<br>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `ModulePlanParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `ModulePlanParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<br>

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T13-0/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="600" />

<br>

The `Model` component,

* stores the module plan data i.e., all `Module` objects (which are contained in `UniqueModuleList` objects).
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` object.
* stores a `ModuleData` object that represents the information on all modules. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyModuleData` object.
* does not depend on any of the other four components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The module plan data is split into different semesters (e.g. Year 1 S1, Year 1 S2, Year 2 S1, etc). Instead of one `UniqueModuleList` storing all of the user's modules across multiple semesters, each semester's modules are stored in their own `UniqueModuleList` object. Nevertheless, modules are required to be unique across semesters, meaning that the same module will be prevented from being added to multiple semesters. The implementation of this check can be found in `ModulePlanSemesterList`.

</box>

<br>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T13-0/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

<br>

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve modifiable objects that belong to the `Model`)

<br>

### Database component

**API** : [`Database.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T13-0/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/database/Database.java)

<puml src="diagrams/DatabaseClassDiagram.puml" width="250" />

<br>

The `Database` component,
* reads the module information from JSON format to the corresponding `ModuleData` object.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Database` component's job is to retrieve read-only objects that belong to the `Model`)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The module data is stored within the resource folder. In the case where the data cannot be read successfully, a `RuntimeException` is deliberately triggered to forcefully halt the application's execution. This is necessary because all features are reliant on the module data.

</box>

<br>

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the [`seedu.address.commons`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T13-0/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons) package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features and commands are implemented.

* [Module Database Feature](#module-database-feature)
* [Module Plan Feature](#module-plan-feature)
* [UI Feature](#ui-feature)
* [Module Storage Feature](#module-storage-feature)
* [Info Module Command](#info-module-command)

<br>

### Module Database Feature

**Overview:**

ModCraft contains an internal list of all possible modules, which forms the backbone of the application. This `ModuleData` allows for validation of user input and provides the required module information to be displayed.

The module information is stored as `moduleinfo.json` in the `src/main/resources/database` folder. Users are not permitted to access the file as uninformed modifications could cause the application to invariably fail at startup.

**Feature details:**

1.   When the user launches the application, the data is converted from JSON format to the `ModuleData` class, which supports verification and retrieval of `Module` information.
2.   During command execution, the `ModuleCode` input by the user is validated to exist within `ModuleData`.
3.   If the `ModuleCode` is found to be invalid, an error message is displayed to the user.
4.   Otherwise, the command execution continues to retrieve information about the `Module` if needed. The content of this step differs between the different commands, more details are provided for each individual command below.

**Initialization sequence:**
1. At startup, `MainApp` calls `DatabaseManager#readDatabase` to attempt to parse the `moduleinfo.json` file.
2. The `DatabaseManager` deserializes the JSON file into a `JsonSerializableModuleData` object by calling `JsonUtil#readJsonResource`. <br>
   2a. The `JsonSerializableModuleData` object represents a list of `JsonAdaptedDbModule` objects, which are created during deserialization.
3. The `DatabaseManager` then calls `JsonSerailizableModuleData#toModelType` to create the `ModuleData` object. <br>
   3a. `JsonSerailizableModuleData` calls `JsonAdaptedDbModule#toModelType` for the creation of each module.
4. The `ModuleData` is returned to `MainApp` where it is used to initialize `ModelManager`, which is used during command execution.
5. A `DataLoadingException` is thrown if any of the above steps fail, which could happen if
   * the file cannot be found,
   * an error occurs during deserialization, or
   * the data contains invalid values.


This can be shown through following sequence diagram:

<puml src="diagrams/ModuleDataInitSequenceDiagram.puml" />

### Module Plan Feature
- how semesters are setup
- what happens a user attempts to add a duplicate module

### UI Feature?
- how the ui is setup
- what happens when the user inputs a command

### Module Storage Feature
- how the storage works
- what happens when it fails to load
- what happens when the user modifies the moduleplan
- userprefs considered the same feature? if too long can split into another one

### Info Module Command

**Overview:**

**Feature details:**


### Add Module Command
**Overview:**
The `add` command is used to add a module to the module plan with the information fields `Module Code`, `Year Taken`,
    `Semester Taken`, and `Grade`.

The format for the `add` command can be found [here](#adding-a-module)

**Feature details:**
1. The user executes the `add` command.
2. If any of the fields are not provided, an error message with the appropriate command usage will be displayed.
3. If any of the command parameters are invalid, an error message with the appropriate parameter format will be displayed.
4. The `Module` is then searched in the `model` to see if it is an existing module that NUS offers. If the module is not
offered, an error message will be displayed.
5. The `Module` is then checked with `ModulePlan` to see if it has already been added to the module plan previously.
If the module has already been added the User's module plan, an error message will be displayed.
6. If all the previous stages complete without exceptions or errors, the `Module` will be added to the `ModulePlan`

<puml src="diagrams/AddModuleActivityDiagram.puml" width="450" />


### Edit Module Command

<br>

#### Implementation

The edit mechanism uses `EditModuleDescriptor` to abstract out the fields to edit. It can be found as a publicly accessible class within `EditCommand`. Currently, it only contains fields for `Year`, `Semester` and `Grade`, which are the only attributes of `Module` that can be edited for now. Besides this, it largely follows the parser and command structure as described in [Logic](#logic-component).

We shall now illustrate how `EditModuleDescriptor` is used.

Here is a *Sequence Diagram* showing the parser in action:

<puml src="diagrams/EditParseSequenceDiagram.puml" width="450" />

And here is a *Sequence Diagram* showing the command being executed:

<puml src="diagrams/EditExecuteSequenceDiagram.puml" width="450" />

As can be seen, this is a helpful class to store fields that need to be edited.

### Delete Module Command

**Overview:**<br>

The `delete` command is used to delete a module from the module plan. The module can only be deleted if it is already present in one of the semesters in the module plan.<br>

The format of the `delete` command can be found [here](https://ay2324s1-cs2103t-t13-0.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#deleting-a-module-delete).<br>

**Feature details:**<br>

1. The user executes the `delete` command.
2. If the module code field is not provided, an error message with the correct command usage will be shown.
3. If invalid module code format is provided, an error message with the correct module code format will be shown.
4. If valid module code format is provided but `Module` does not exist in database, an error message informing user that the `Module` does not exist will be shown.
5. The `Module` is then cross-referenced in the `Model` to check if a module with the same `ModuleCode` exists in the module plan.
6. If the module does not exist in the module plan, an error message informing the user that the `Module` has not added to the module plan will be shown.
7. If all previous steps are completed without exceptions, the new `Module` will be successfully deleted from the module plan.

<br>

The following activity diagram shows the logic of deleting a `Module` from the module plan:

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteCommandActivityDiagram.puml" width="450" />

<br>

The sequence of the `delete` command is as follows:<br>

1. The user inputs the `delete` command.<br>
e.g. `delete CS3230`
2. The `LogicManager` calls the `ModulePlanParser#parseCommand` to parse the command.
3. The `ModulePlanParser` then creates a new `DeleteCommandParser` to parse the fields provided by the user and a new `DeleteCommand` is created.
4. The `DeleteCommand` checks if the `ModuleCode` is valid by calling `Model#checkDbValidModuleCode`.
4. The `DeleteCommand` then checks if the `Model` contains a module with the same `ModuleCode` by calling `Model#getModule`.
5. If the `ModuleCode` is valid and `Model` contains the module, the `DeleteCommand` calls `Model#deleteModule` to delete the module from to the module plan.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `delete` command works:

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteCommandSequenceDiagram.puml" width="450" />

<br>

### Calculate CAP Command

**Overview:**<br>

The `calculateCAP` command is used to calculate the Cumulative Average Point (CAP) of all valid modules in the module plan, using their grade points and modular credits. <br>

The format of the `calculateCAP` command can be found [here](https://ay2324s1-cs2103t-t13-0.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#calculating-the-total-current-cap-calculatecap).<br>

**Feature details:**<br>

1. The user executes the `calculateCAP` command.
2. If the previous step is completed without exceptions, the CAP will be calculated and displayed.

<br>

The sequence of the `calculateCAP` command is as follows:<br>

1. The user inputs the `calculateCAP` command.<br>
2. The `LogicManager` calls the `ModulePlanParser#parseCommand` to parse the command.
3. The `ModulePlanParser` then creates a new `CalculateCapCommand`.
4. The `CalculateCapCommand` calculates the CAP by calling `Model#getCap`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `calculateCAP` command works:

<puml src="diagrams/CalculateCapSequenceDiagram.puml" width="450" />

<br>

### Calculate Modular Credits (MCs) Command

**Overview:**<br>

The `calculateMC` command is used to calculate the total sum of Modular Credits (MCs) of all modules in the module plan, regardless of their grades. <br>

The format of the `calculateMC` command can be found [here](https://ay2324s1-cs2103t-t13-0.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#calculating-the-total-current-modular-credits-mcs-calculatemc).<br>

**Feature details:**<br>

1. The user executes the `calculateMC` command.
2. If the previous step is completed without exceptions, the number of MCs will be calculated and displayed.

<br>

The sequence of the `calculateMC` command is as follows:<br>

1. The user inputs the `calculateMC` command.<br>
2. The `LogicManager` calls the `ModulePlanParser#parseCommand` to parse the command.
3. The `ModulePlanParser` then creates a new `CalculateMcCommand`.
4. The `CalculateMcCommand` calculates the CAP by calling `Model#totalModularCredits`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `calculateMC` command works:

<puml src="diagrams/CalculateMcSequenceDiagram.puml" width="450" />

<br>

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedModulePlan`. It extends `ModulePlan` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `ModulePlanStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedModulePlan#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current module plan state in its history.
* `VersionedModulePlan#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous module plan state from its history.
* `VersionedModulePlan#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone module plan state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitModulePlan()`, `Model#undoModulePlan()` and `Model#redoModulePlan()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedModulePlan` will be initialized with the initial module plan state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single module plan state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" />

Step 2. The user executes `delete CS1010` command to delete the module `CS1010` in the module plan. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitModulePlan()`, causing the modified state of the module plan after the `delete CS1010` command executes to be saved in the `modulePlanStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted module plan state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" />

Step 3. The user executes `add CS2030 â€¦â€‹` to add a new module. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitModulePlan()`, causing another modified module plan state to be saved into the `modulePlanStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitModulePlan()`, so the module plan state will not be saved into the `modulePlanStateList`.

</box>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the module was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoModulePlan()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous module plan state, and restores the module plan to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" />


<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial ModulePlan state, then there are no previous ModulePlan states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoModulePlan()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoModulePlan()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the module plan to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `modulePlanStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest module plan state, then there are no undone ModulePlan states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoModulePlan()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

<br>

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire module plan.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the module being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

<br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Future enhancements**

For our next steps, we plan to add the following features:
* Check if a module is CS/CU or not, and check if the grade given from user input is valid for that module.
* Check which semesters a module is offered, and check if the semester given from user input is valid for that module.
* Check for a module's pre-requisites, and check if they are fulfilled before allowing the user to add the module.
* Check for a module's pre-clusions, and prevent users from adding modules that are pre-clusions of each other.
* Check for a module's co-requisites, and remind users to add modules that are co-requisites of each other and to take them concurrently.
* Check for a module's availability of S/U options, and prevent users from inputting S/U grades to non-S/U-able modules.
* Add support for allowing users to add a module that was failed in a previous semester to another new semester.
