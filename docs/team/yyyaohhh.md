## Project ModCraft


ModCraft is an app that provides a fast and easy way for NUS students to track courses
to take to meet graduation requirements and plan courses to take. The user interacts
with it using a Command Line Interface (CLI), and it has a Graphic User Interface (GUI) created with JavaFX.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
